🌾 Crop Recommendation Model
This repository contains a Machine Learning model that predicts the best crop to cultivate based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions.

🚀 Features

Predicts optimal crops using soil properties and climate data

Trained on real-world agricultural datasets

Uses Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall as inputs

Built with machine learning algorithms for high accuracy

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy (for model training)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for training & experimentation)

📌 How to Use

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation-model.git
cd crop-recommendation-model

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Model

Open crop_recommendation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, and run the notebook to test predictions.
